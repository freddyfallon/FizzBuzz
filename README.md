# FizzBuzz
This project was created to help me build up my experience in RSpec.

# What it's comprised of
- The [fizzBuzz_spec.rb file](https://github.com/freddyfallon/FizzBuzz/blob/master/spec/fizzbuzz_spec.rb) file. Lists all examples and their expectations.
- The [fizzbuzz.rb](https://github.com/freddyfallon/FizzBuzz/blob/master/lib/fizzbuzz.rb) file. This contains the relevant Fizzbuzz method.

# How to run
On your machine, RSpec must first be installed. To do this, simply enter the following:

```shell
gem install rspec```

Once RSpec is installed, and you are in the FizzBuzz directory, simply run:

```shell
rspec```

This will list out which examples have passed (all of them), and which ones have failed (none of them).
